The employee_groups table had an incorrect NOT NULL constraint on project_id column which was preventing group creation. Updated database to allow nullable project_id as groups can exist independently of projects
- **Logout Redirect Fix**: Fixed logout functionality to redirect users to linxap.com website instead of showing error page. Updated logout route to use proper redirect instead of status response
- **Database Connection Resilience**: Implemented comprehensive connection retry logic with exponential backoff, health monitoring, and connection management. Added DatabaseConnectionManager with automatic reconnection for connection failures, health checks every 60 seconds, and shorter-lived connections for non-critical operations. Created db-wrapper.ts with executeRead/executeWrite functions for operation-specific retry logic. Enhanced database stability for Neon serverless environment with admin command termination handling
- **Employee Dashboard Text Spacing**: Fixed text spacing issues throughout employee dashboard by implementing proper flex column layouts and explicit block display classes. Resolved concatenated text issues in both header ("Employee Dashboard" + "General â€¢ ID") and test cards ("Oracle Database Architect" + "Oracle Administration")
- **Test Details Screen**: Created advanced clickable test details page with comprehensive tabs (Overview, Questions, Assignments, Results, Analytics). Made test names clickable throughout the system for detailed views
